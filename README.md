A Currency Converter is a tool or application that allows users to convert one currency into another based on current exchange rates. It takes the amount of money in one currency and provides the equivalent value in another currency. This tool is commonly used for international travel, online shopping, or financial transactions to help individuals or businesses understand the value of money in different countries. Currency converters typically update exchange rates regularly to reflect real-time market changes.
